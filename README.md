# scraper_method_comparison
A comparison of the efficiency of various methods of scraping.

## Purpose

The initial plan is to write a simple scraper using requests and compare the efficiency of it to a version using asynchronous requests.
Potentially add in versions using ScraPy and Selenium for comparison too.
